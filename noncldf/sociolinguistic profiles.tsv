There were also people there in more isolated places in Ermera who do/did not speak Tetun, they only spoke Mambai and Kemak, and when they were speaking I could not understand them so I just smiled. In Lospalos, there are also still people who do not speak Tetun, and we just have to adapt to that."				"Fataluku: Native; I was born here and I speak it 100% fluently; Makasae I also speak fluently as I learned from my parents, but I tend to mix Fataluku words in it; Sa'ane, one of the two languages of Luro, I also speak at a basic level; Tetun Terik I speak at a basic level because I stayed in the house of a Tetun Terik speaker for a while; Indonesian: Proficient in day to day language, not in scientific language; Tetun Dili: proficient; Portuguese I do not really speak."	See previous question.	"Before going to school, I spoke Makasae with my parents at home. In primary school which I started in 1994 I learned to speak Indonesian, as Timor Leste was not yet independent then. In school I also learned Fataluku, because all my friends there spoke Fataluku. At home I kept on speaking Makasae with my parents, but when Fataluku friends were visiting we used Fataluku. I entered junior high school in 2002, and that is when I started to learn Tetun Dili, because then Timor Leste became independent. I went to a Catholic school and some of our teachers were Catholic pastors and others were teachers but all of them came from other parts of Timor Leste, e.g. Baucau or Dili, so they used Tetun in class. "	I learned Indonesian in primary school but we also watch Indonesian tv and listen to Indonesian songs. 	"Makasae from birth, Fataluku when starting primary school."	"Makasae from parents, Fataluku from friends in the village."	"Fataluku is a language that is rather 'radical'. For example, if there are 1000 people gathering among which are only 2 Fataluku speakers, we must speak Fataluku. If we speak Tetun, we are considered 'arrogant' because we don't want to speak Fataluku. Lospalos is known as the region where Fataluku is spoken, even though there is also Makasae and Sa'ane spoken here. If we meet people from Lospalos in another part of Timor Leste, we speak Fataluku. When we meet people from Lure (where Sa'ane is spoken) elsewhere, we speak Tetun. I learned to speak Makasae because it is my parents language. When in Dili, I meet with friends who can speak Fataluku and also some who can speak Makasae, we still use Fataluku, not Makasae, because when we use Makasae we are labeled with the Fataluku word kela 'despicable, coarse, not respectable' (Indonesian hina). If the speaker does not know Fataluku we use Tetun, in any case we would never use Makasae. (In the Indonesian times, we would use Indonesian, but nowadays, when someone uses Indonesian, we say that he has not become independent yet and wants to remember the Indonesian period. A truly free Timor Leste person should talk Tetun, not Indonesian.)(This is on the 2nd clip, from 9:30 onwards)."		Makasae with my family but Tetun with wife and child.

We can also speak Tetun but Fataluku is preferred because speaking Tetun is considered arrogant."	"Indonesian with Indonesians, Tetun Dili with speakers from other parts of Timor Leste."	"Fataluku; if there are other language speakers present we can also speak Tetun, but this is quickly regarded as arrogant so we don't do it unless it is necessary. We don't use Makasae when there are Fataluku speakers present because they will not feel happy (tersinggung 'displeased')."	"Fataluku, but mass and hymns are in Tetun/Portuguese."	"His primary school was in Indonesian. Nowadays, all schools starting from kindergarten till university use Portuguese textbooks, with Tetun Dili explanations from teachers. Not all teachers understand what is in the books, it depends on their education. Many of them were trained in the Indonesian time, and did not know Portuguese, so they now follow courses to learn Portuguese. It is a bit hard but we must learn together, because we are forced to learn it. (Clip 3, around 2:50 onwards.)"	Fataluku or any language we like.	Tetun Dili	Fataluku and Makasae (see also previous questions about the low status of Makasae).											Fataluku. I tend to mix Fataluku words with Makasae.	"In Fataluku, a beautiful expression is Puru pale, to say as farewell, it means ""take care"". A coarse expression is Umumara peono, lit. 'die there invite' > fuck off, when you say this you want people to piss off.  "	"Fataluku and Makasae are both influenced by Indonesian and Tetun. Here, Fataluku is not influenced by Makasae ('how would we otherwise understand each other?'), but Makasae is influenced by Fataluku because the majority is Fataluku here."	"Yes, Fataluku and Makasae are old languages, which we inherited."	"(Clip 3; 14:30) Yes, there is traditional language that is spoken by the traditional leaders when they pray etc. The normal people cannot speak it and do not understand most of it. For us it is taboo to use it. This language they do not learn but it just appears in them. (Clip 4) They use it to call and talk to the spirits of the dead. This ability to speak the ritual language is inherited. If ordinary people use it, we are punished, blood will come out of our ears and we die."			The words of Fataluku and Makasae are completely different. The intonation is also different and the pronounciation of certain sounds is different: e.g. pig in Makasae  is bai and Fataluku pai. 	no data	no data	no data	no data	"Everywhere in Lospalos there are mixes of Makasae and Fataluku speakers, some places have more Fataluku, others have more Makasae. There are also speakers of Sa'ane. But Fataluku is considered the most important. Makalero is spoken in the Iliomar and Viqueque area."			"There are cultural differences, e.g. when a Makasae person dies, we have to bring buffalo. But if a Fataluku person dies, we can bring buffalo or horses."	"Children must learn to speak Fataluku, and 99% of the children speak it. Even when I speak with my child in Tetun, she will have to learn Fataluku when she grows up and goes to school. And she will learn Makasae from her grandparents."	"No, we do not encourage her to speak Fataluku because she will learn it anyway when she goes to school. Makasae she already learns now, when talking to her grandparents. With me and my wife and her parents, she learns to speak Tetun Dili. "	"We just explain: this is a word from a language from there a nd there, this is a coarse word, this is a good one etc. We just point out and explain differences but we do not punish the child for mistakes."	"The most important language is Tetun, because it is our national language."	"Fataluku and Makasae do not ave to be taught in schools. But in my opinion, tourists / strangers that come to Fataluku should learn Fataluku. It should not be the case that e.g. Australians come here and impose English on us, because they are the ones that come to stay here, so they must learn our language so that we can hold on to our own language and culture. (Clip 4: 15: 15)"	"In the case of boys they will bring their wife to stay here with us so they will speak Fataluku. In the case of girls that move to live with their husband elsewhere in Timor Leste, they will speak Tetun. If they marry an Indonesian, they will speak Indonesian, if they marry a white person, they will speak English, that's not a problem. In this village, there are 5 or 6 (men and  women) that married a foreigner from Portugal, Switzerland or Australia. They come here for the holidays. In a hundred years from now, we will all speak English here. All the children really want to learn to speak English because they want to interact with the foreigners. Portuguese is a problem, we never use it. We learn it in school but immediately forget it because no one speaks it."	Maria Ifoni Liwu	MIL	Female	30-Mar-98	17	"Hewa, Flores Timur"	"Hewa, Flores Timur 8ç35'40.4""S 122ç42'23.9""E"	"Hewa (and some Sika, Lamaholot)"	student		SMA	Petrus Welin Liwu	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Veronika Dai Narek	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa			Unmarried	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A		no	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A			fluent	fluent	When entering SD	Teacher	As a child	From parents			Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	N/A	Indonesian	Hewa	Indonesian	N/A	Indonesian	Indonesian	Hewa	Indonesian	Hewa																																	Erfinlia Olon Liwu	EOL	Female	10-Mar-88	18	Hewa	"Hewa 8°35'40.4""S 122°42'23.9""E"	Hewa and some Sika and Lamaholot	Student		SMA	Pilipus Ike Ipir	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Hewa	Kiara Dua Liwu	Adonara	Lamaholot-Adonara	Adonara	Lamaholot-Adonara	"When in Adonara, she spoke Lmh Adonara, after moving to Hewa, she spoke Hewa."
